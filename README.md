The installation directory for the various files roughly looks like this

     |   ├── pywps.cfg
     |   └── /processes/
     |       └── __init__.py
     |       └── process1.py
     └── /downloads/

It is not the name of the python script, but the name of the "Class" defined within that determines the name of the service.
