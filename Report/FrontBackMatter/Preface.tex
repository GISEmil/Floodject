This project is created by Ioannis Angelidis, David Nagy and Emil MÃ¸ller Rasmussen as part of the Geoinformatics programme Master's thesis. The work presented here was inspired by a former project completed during our 2nd semester. This work can be found in the project library of Aalborg University of Copenhagen under the title :
\begin{itemize}
\item Flood Mitigation: Flood modeling of sea water stowing - the development of a tool to facilitate disaster management.
\end{itemize}

Throughout this report, an extensive codebase is created which can be accessed at
